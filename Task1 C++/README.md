# About
The broader scope of this project is to practice and showcase our understanding of Object Oriented Programming. More specifically, the use of **encapsulation** and base **class inheritence**. We aim at creating an ATM software which has the following features to both a 'Savings' and a 'Checking' account: *Deposit, Widthdraw, and CheckBalance*. And, the use of OOP provides layered security for the users information.

# Requirements 
* C++ IDE
* Understanding of OOP concepts
